## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
cleaned_airquality <- na.omit(airquality)
```

Statistics for the Ozone level

```{r}
mean(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
sd(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
min(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
max(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
```

Statistics for the Temperature

```{r}
mean(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
sd(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
min(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
max(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
```

Extract the matrices

```{r}
x <- cbind(cars$speed)
y <- as.matrix(cars$dist,1)
x_trans <- t(x)
```

Calculate the beta estimates

```{r}
Estimates <- function(x,y) {
beta <- solve(x_trans%*%x) %*%x_trans%*%y
sd <- 
beta
}
```
