Cleaning the data
```{r}
cleaned_airquality <- na.omit(airquality)
```

Ozone stats
```{r}
mean(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
sd(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
min(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
max(cleaned_airquality$Ozone)
```

Temp stats
```{r}
mean(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
sd(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
min(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
max(cleaned_airquality$Temp)
```

Extracting the matrices
```{r}
x <- cbind(cars$speed)
y <- as.matrix(cars$dist,1)
x_trans <- t(x)
```

Function for estimates
```{r}
Estimates <- function(x,y) {
beta <- solve(x_trans%*%x) %*%x_trans%*%y
sd <- 
beta
}
```
